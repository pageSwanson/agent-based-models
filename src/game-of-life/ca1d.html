<h1>A cellular automaton</h1>

<br/>

<p>
Below is a cellular automaton. With a simple set of rules, we can create complex patterns that mimic behaviors.
Each 'cell' in the model below can either be living or dead. Each one is aware of it's neighbors. 
Every second, a cell responds to its neighbors, and changes.
